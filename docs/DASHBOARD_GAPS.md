# Dashboard Comparison: Current vs Mockup

## What We Have ✅
- Stats cards (4 cards: Total Earnings, Books Published, Total Sales, Available Balance)
- Recent Sales section
- Top Performing Books section
- Basic layout structure
- Mockup reference collapsible section

## What's Missing from the Mockup ❌

Based on the mockup `afrireads_author_dashboard_1764672335838.png`, here are the gaps:

### 1. **Visual Design Issues**
- [ ] Stats cards may need better visual hierarchy
- [ ] Missing earnings chart/graph visualization
- [ ] Book thumbnails/covers not showing in tables
- [ ] Color scheme may not match exactly

### 2. **Missing Components**
- [ ] Earnings trend chart (line/bar chart showing monthly revenue)
- [ ] My Books table with actual book covers
- [ ] Recent activity feed
- [ ] Quick actions panel

### 3. **Data Visualization**
- [ ] No charts or graphs for earnings trends
- [ ] Missing visual indicators for book performance
- [ ] No progress bars or visual metrics

### 4. **Layout & Spacing**
- [ ] Grid layout may need adjustment
- [ ] Card shadows and borders may differ
- [ ] Typography sizes and weights

## Specific Issues to Fix

### Priority 1: Add Earnings Chart
The mockup shows a revenue chart. We need to add a proper chart component.

### Priority 2: Book Covers in Tables
Recent sales and top books should show book cover thumbnails.

### Priority 3: Better Visual Hierarchy
Improve spacing, shadows, and overall visual polish.

## Next Steps
1. Review the mockup image in detail
2. Identify exact visual differences
3. Implement missing chart component
4. Add book cover images
5. Adjust styling to match mockup exactly
