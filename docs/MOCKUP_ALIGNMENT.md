# Landing Page Mockup Alignment

Based on `afrireads_landing_page_1764672267589.png`, the mockup shows:

## Sections in Mockup (Top to Bottom):
1. **Navigation Bar** - Logo, links, CTA button
2. **Hero Section** - Large heading, description, CTA buttons
3. **Featured Books** - Carousel/grid of book cards
4. **Categories Grid** - 6 category cards with icons
5. **Featured Authors** - Author profile cards
6. **Footer** - Links and copyright

## Current Implementation:
✅ Navigation Bar - Matches (with Categories & Authors links added)
✅ Hero Section - Matches
✅ Featured Books - Implemented
❌ Categories - Removed (now just a link)
❌ Featured Authors - Removed (now just a link)
✅ CTA Banner - Added
✅ Footer - Enhanced

## User Request:
- Remove Categories section → Add as nav link ✅
- Remove Featured Authors section → Add as nav link ✅
- Simplify the page ✅

## Result:
The current implementation is now SIMPLER than the mockup, focusing only on:
- Hero + Featured Books + CTA + Footer

This aligns with the user's request to simplify while keeping navigation accessible.
